# Prework - *Background color changer*

Submitted by: **Saurabh Ghosh**

**Background color changer** is an app that... changes its background color randomly when the button is tapped by the user

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite applications are Gmail, Microsoft Outlook and Apple Music. I enjoy them because of the functionality they offer me, which enhances my life, plus all of them have beautiful interfaces which make great use of dark mode and colorful UI elements. 

I would like to build an application that would enable students at my university to book tutoring appintments for their particular class. I'd keep it a simple list of introductory classes like math and essay writing.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had to read over the background regarding what the commands mean in Swift multiple times before I found out the correct place to enter them. It was frustrating when my app kept showing error messages or undesirable behavior and I did not know how to troubleshoot. Finally I managed to crack the proverbial code.
